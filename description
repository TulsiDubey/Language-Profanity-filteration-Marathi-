This project is a Marathi text and audio processing tool developed using `Streamlit`, focused on profanity filtering and NLP analysis. It handles text inputs, uploaded audio files, and real-time recordings, processing them for insights and filtering inappropriate content. Key features include profanity detection and substitution for Marathi text (both native script and transliterated), transcription of Marathi audio using Google's Web Speech API, and NLP analysis powered by `spaCy`. The tool performs tasks like language detection, tokenization, sentence segmentation, lemmatization, lexical and syntactic analysis, and stop-word identification. With its interactive Streamlit interface, users can seamlessly input text, upload audio files, or record speech in real-time, making it a robust platform for Marathi linguistic analysis and content moderation.
